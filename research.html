            <h3>Automatic Surface Plasmon Microscopy based on Object Detection Network</h3>
            <p>
                Surface Plasmon Microscopy (SPM) features both high sensitivity and resolution.
                This work aimed to automatically conduct SPM measurements on batch of images.
                To do this, object detection networks (Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO) were used to classify and localize surface plasmon profiles.

            <h3>Graph Representation of EEG Electrodes for Epileptic Seizure Detection</h3>
            <p>
                This work aimed to detect epliptic seizure using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.
                Most research concactnates EEG signal from different channels, which neglects the inter-channel correlation.
                This work considered the 1) geodestic distance and 2) spectral coherence of EEG electrodes by embedding them in a graph Representation.
                Later, the classification was perfromed using Graph Neural Network (GNN).

            <h3>Physical State Classification using Ear-ECG and Ear-PPG</h3>
            <p>
                This work aimed to classifify three physical states using ECG and PPG measured around the ears.
                Ear-ECG and Ear-PPG contain less motion artefacts, and do not hinder subjects' movements.
                These advantages make ear measurements ideal for the monitoring of physical states.
                To classify physical states, time- and frequency-domain HRV features were extracted.
                To help distinguishing slow breathing, breathing intervals and SpO2 were extracted from PPG.
                It was proven that PPG features improved classification accuracy (95% cross-validation accuracy).
                New method based on automatically pre-trained matched filter was also used to extract low SNR Ear-ECG peaks.
